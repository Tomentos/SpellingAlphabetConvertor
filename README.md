# SpellingAlphabetConvertor
Converts your text to spelling alphabet in case you are in a phone call and for some reason decide to use this instead of any web-based version or just straight up the conversion table. I made it to train my JS a bit.

The script only supports the Swiss, German and International Spelling Table.

To execute the script, simply double-click run.bat
