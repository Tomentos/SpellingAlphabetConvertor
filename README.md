# SpellingAlphabetConvertor
*Converts your text to spelling alphabet in case you are in a phone call and for some reason decide to use this instead of any web-based version or just straight up the conversion table.*

I made this to train my JS a bit so the code most likely is a complete mess.

## Requirements
All you need to run the convertor is a stable release of Node JS.
You can download Node JS on the [official webiste](https://nodejs.org/en/download) or by using the [Node version manager](https://www.npmjs.com/package/n)

In case something isn't working right, you should try to reinstall the modules.
After deleting the node_modules folder, open a command line in the project folder and type `npm install`.
Alternitively, if you have the module yarn, or any similar module, you can also use `yarn` or the command used for your preferred module to install modules from npm.

## Download
To download the convertor, go to the [release page of this repository](https://github.com/Tomentos/SpellingAlphabetConvertor/releases) and choose your preferred archive.
Unpack the archive afterwords and if you meet the defined requirements, that is all you need to do to get it running.

In case you need to download the modules again, open a command line in the project folder and type `npm install`.
Alternitively, if you have the module yarn, or any similar module, you can also use `yarn` or the command used for your preferred module to install modules from npm.

## Usage
Only the Swiss, German and the International spelling tables are supported here. So if you need any other spelling table, this won't help you.
After you succesfully downloaded the convertor and meeting all the requirements, you can execute it by using on of the following ways:

- On Windows
Go to the main folder of the project and run `run.bat`

- On Linux
Go to the main folder of the project and run `run.sh`
